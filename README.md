# ESR Meter

The schematic of this meter was published in an Italian magazine Nuova Elettronica No. 212.

## Overview

The schematic of this meter was published in an Italian magazine Nuova Elettronica No. 212. I found it more than five years ago on [Talino Tribuzio's IZ7ATH site](http://www.qsl.net/iz7ath/web/02_brew/15_lab/06_esr/index.htm) when I was looking for a simple ESR meter circuit.

## Project goals

1. Fitting the circuit in an enclosure box.
2. Dual power supply battery and external.

## Mechanics

A ready available 118x78x33mm plastic box which was purchased on AliExpress. The box is made of a good quality plastic, has enough space for the PCB and a battery compartment.
